## Apocrypha

I'm going to try and complete a legitimate proof I'm working on for P=NP by trying to reduce the Travelling Salesman Problem from NP to P in polynomial time by constructing the complete graph, trisecting within the nC3 triangular 3-sets, possibly repeatedly and then seeing if you can construct a worst case convergence in polynomially-time many parallel threads. Anyways, I don't know really I can only assume that CS did an exhaustive proof search but if a constructive proof does not exist then NP cannot be contained in P. Due to the mutual interreducibility of one NP problem to another in polynomial-time, then if I can construct a provably "maximally efficient" solution for TSP then it maps to either P or NP and therefore decides the yay/nay of their equivalence relation into potentially a proper set containment. Be back later on...

Advanced Physical Device Conjecture:

Feynman (Specifiable) Mind Mapping Machine.
 
There are (remote but uncentralizably undisentangleable) read signals and write signals teleportable backwards as an interface around the space-time indexes of a (course grid within an) open ball around a (identifiably detectable) physics Kolmogorov Complexity system. This machine shoots enough photons (nay time reversing scorpion tachyons) etc. at the electromagnetic field around (say a human) to measure their resonance reliability signature to formulate dynamic system theories in order to predict their emergent (slowly specifying) biologically originating latency behavior to "yoink" intellectual property. This is called a Yoneda’s Lemma harvesting of an individual’s Kantian categorizations.

Just kidding <3 to all my friends at Microsoft and Google AI!
